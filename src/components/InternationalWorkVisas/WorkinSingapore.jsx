                            <h4>Steps to apply for Singapore Work Visa</h4>
                            <p>The application process for a work visa for Singapore is as follows:</p>
                            <p>Step 1: Get a job offer in Singapore.</p>
                            <p>Step 2: If you are still in your native country, your employer or an Employment Agency (EA) will have to submit a work visa application through EP Online. They need to pay a processing fee.</p>
                            <p>Step 3: When the application is accepted, your employer will get an In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter, with which you can enter Singapore.</p>
                            <p>Step 4: In case the application is rejected, an In-Principle Rejection letter will be sent to your potential employer instead. You won’t be issued a work visa.</p>
                            <p>Step 5: The IPA letter allows you to travel to Singapore.</p>
                            <p>Once you reach Singapore, your employer or an EA applies through EP Online to receive your Singapore work visa. They will have to pay the fee again, which would be for the work Pass per se.</p>
                            <p>Once you get your work Pass, a notification letter will be sent to you. This letter contains details on whether you need to take your photo and fingerprints. It allows you also to commence working and leave and enter Singapore until an Employment Card is issued to you.</p>
                            <p>You need to register at the Employment Pass Services Centre (EPSC) within two weeks of receiving your Pass. Once you register, a Pass Card will be issued to you – generally within four working days.</p>
                            <p>Similar is the process to apply for a Singapore e-visa for Indians. For your information, the Singapore work permit costs SGD35.</p>

                            <p>The Skillselect is designed to assess the skills of applicants under a point-based system so that immigrants with the right skills can be selected. The applicants are given points under the following criteria:</p>
                            <ul className='international-list-bx'>

                                <li><span>Australian qualifications:</span> You can get five points if you have an Australian qualification from an Australian educational institute.</li>

This visa does not require the sponsorship of an employer. You can use the SkillSelect tool to find out if your skills are in demand.</li>
                                <li><span>Employer Nomination Scheme:</span> Under this scheme, a permanent work visa is given to workers sponsored by their companies.</li>

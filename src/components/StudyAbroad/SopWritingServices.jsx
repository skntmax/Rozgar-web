                            <p>If you are planning to study abroad in the top universities across the globe, then you must have come across the term Statement of Purpose and if you are wondering what is a Statement of Purpose? What does it mean? Then, don’t worry, we have all your answers regarding the statement of purpose and how it is capable of ensuring your admission in the top colleges all across the world.</p>
                            <p>A Statement of Purpose or SOP is kind of an admission essay that every student has to present to the University, along with all the other documents. It is a compulsory submission and presents a clear picture of your application in front of the University authorities in a transparent way.</p>
                            <h4>Significance Of SOP</h4>
                            <p>Now, you must be wondering that if I have to submit all my academic and residential documents to the University, then why is there a need of a separate Statement of Purpose. The answer is quite simple. All the other documents like your CGPA result, IELTS score, VISA letter, character certificate etcetera clearly mention your academic record and character to the institute but a SOP has some special importance among these formal documents.</p>
                            <p>A SOP is a document that is curated by your side, not by your previous college or embassy, in which you’ve to clearly mention all the aspects that would be helpful in securing your admission into the University. These aspects include your motivation to study in that institute, your aspirations from the future, what you expect to become after studying there, your best personality traits, qualities, strengths and a lot more. In this way, you get to briefly present your application in a much conversational and effective way to the University. An SOP is not a highly formal document but a medium through which you can freely outline your skills and qualifications that are in the favor of you being the right candidate for their University.</p>
                            <h4>Is There A Pattern For A SOP ?</h4>
                            <p>Although, the Statement of Purpose does not have a pre-defined pattern that should be followed but still you must follow a basic yet effective structure to provide the best of information about yourself in a communicative manner.</p>
                            <p>The SOP must start with an Introduction. Now, this Introduction is not exactly your formal introduction but it should carry all the headers or bullet points of the qualities and achievements you’ve discussed further briefly in the SOP.</p>
                            <p>Then, comes the body. The main part of the SOP as you’ll be directly showcasing all your positives and negatives in front of the authorities. It should be crisp, to the point yet highly elaborate in nature.</p>
                            <p>For the Conclusion part, you should give a final call back to your motivation behind your studies in that particular University, as in, what are the attributes of the institute that make it the ideal one for you etcetera.</p>
                            <p>Now, it must be clear to you how you should frame your best Statement of Purpose so as to increase your chances of admission. But, to be more cautious, there are a few things to avoid as well. The tone of the SOP should not be too formal but a bit conversational and professional in a general way. Don’t be too repetitive about the information, for example, don’t mention your CGPA or IELTS score in every next sentence as every candidate must’ve cleared IELTS, you should try to focus on the points that define your identity. And last but not least, try to make a good connection with the reader through your writing and good use of words.</p>
